\subsection*{2 Conditional probability}
\fi

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{conditional probability} of event $R$ given $C$:
  \begin{equation}
P(R|C)=\frac{P(R\cap C)}{P(C)} 
  \end{equation}
  This is the probability of getting an outcome in event $R$ if we
  know the outcome is in event $C$.
\end{itemize}
