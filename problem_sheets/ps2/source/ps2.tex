\section*{Problem Sheet 2}

\subsection*{Useful facts}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Expected value}. For a discrete random variable with probability $p(x)$ this is
\begin{equation}
\langle g(X) \rangle = \sum_x p(x)g(x)
\end{equation}
For a continuous random variable with density $f(x)$ this is
\begin{equation}
\langle g(X)\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty{f(x)g(x)}dx
\end{equation}


\item \textbf{Mean and variance}. The mean is $\mu=\langle X\rangle$ and the variance is $\sigma^2=\langle(X-\mu)^2\rangle=\langle X^2\rangle - \mu^2$.

\item \textbf{Binomial distibution}. For $n$ independent trials each with $p$ change of success and $q=1-p$ of failure, the probability of $r$ successes is 
\begin{equation}
p(r)=\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\r\end{array}\right)p^rq^{n-r}
\end{equation}
and $\mu=pn$, $\sigma^2=pqn$.

\item \textbf{Poisson distribution}. This has
\begin{equation}
p(r)=\frac{\lambda^r}{r!}e^{-\lambda}
\end{equation}
where $\mu=\lambda$ and $\sigma^2=\lambda$.

\item \textbf{Integrating a polnomial}
\begin{equation}
\int x^n dx=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}
\end{equation}
so the definite integral is
\begin{equation}
\int_{a}^b x^n dx=\frac{b^{n+1}}{n+1}-\frac{a^{n+1}}{n+1}
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Questions}

Four questions, each worth two marks with two marks for attendance.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The illusionist Derren Brown famously flipped a coin on camera
  so that it landed heads ten times in a row; he claimed that this was
  because of his mind powers, in fact it was because of his patience,
  he simply kept trying the trick again and again until it
  worked. It took him nine hours. What is the probability of a coin landing heads ten times in
  a row? If you flip a coin ten times what is the probability of
  getting five heads and five tails?

\item A fisher catches on average one fish every 25 minutes. What is
  the probability that they catche no fish in an hour?

\item The distribution of tree heights in a christmas tree forest is 
\begin{equation}
p(h)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}0.3& 0\le h <2\\0.2& 2\le h<4\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
What is the mean height of trees in the forest?

\item Like the binomial distribution the geometric probability
  distribution is related to a series of independent trials where each
  trial has probability $p$ of success and $q=1-p$ of failure. The
  geometric probability $p(r)$ is the probability that the $r$th trial
  is the first success. It is
\begin{equation}
p(r)=q^{r-1}p
\end{equation}
It can be shown that 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r=1}^\infty p(r)=1
\end{equation}
as it must be. You can assume that here. What is the mean of the geometric probability?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Extra questions}

These are for you to do on your own, not for handing up. Solutions will be included in the solutions section. I haven't added these question yet, but they will be added to the online version of this problem sheet over the next couple of days.
