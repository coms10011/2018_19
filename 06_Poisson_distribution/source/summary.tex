\subsection*{6 Poisson distribution}
\fi


\begin{itemize}

\item In a \textbf{Poisson process} events occur randomly, the rate
  they occur at doesn't change over time and the chance of an event
  occuring doesn't depend on when events happened in the past.
  
  \item The \textbf{Poisson distribution} gives the probability of $r$
    events occuring in a time interval if $\lambda$ is the rate, the average number of events in that period:
\begin{equation}
p(r)=\frac{\lambda^r}{r!}e^{-\lambda}
\end{equation}    

\item There is a fancy derivation of this formula which involves subdividing the interval into small subintervals.

\item It is possible to show $\lambda$ is the average count by writing down the formula for the mean and rearranging the terms.
  \end{itemize}
